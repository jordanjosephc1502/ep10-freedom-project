                        <p class="lead">Gambling is a big problem in modern society. I always felt bad about people taking the risk of losing their money or gaining more money. Many people gamble and lose families, houses, cars, etc. It's very sad how people put their whole lives on the line just to take a risk. The purpose of this website is to help people understand why gambling is dangerous and how it could be harmful. It's also too open people's eyes for justice against gambling and how we could fix this problem for present and future generations.</p>
