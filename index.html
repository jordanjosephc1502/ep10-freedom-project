                        <p class="lead">Gambling is a big problem in modern day society. I always felt bad about people taking the risk of losing their money or gaining more money. Many people gamble and lose families , houses , cars , etc. It's very sad how people put their whole life on the line just to take a risk. The cause of this website is too help people understand why gambling is dangerous and how it could be harmful. Also to open people's eyes for justice too anti gambling and how we could fix this problem for present and future generations</p>

                        <p class="lead">In the future, I feel like anti-gambling will get better but it also can get worst. There are so many online gambling websites and you could wipe your whole account by betting a lot. Casinos or online gambling websites should have a technology that checks how much you make a year or how much money you need so that you use that extra money to waste but don't blow all your money. For example, a person with a lower income will not be able to bet from a person that has a higher income. It will be technology that's on all machines in the casinos and software on websites that use your info to look up how much you make a year and show how much you can gamble. </p>
